# hotel_booking_app

A hotel booking app is a software application designed for users to search and book available hotel accommodations according to their preferences. The app provides users with a list of available hotels, along with their respective details such as location, price, room types, amenities, and reviews from other users.

## Getting Started

The app contains a home page with a search bar and a static list of hotels categorized by sections. There is a bottom bar that allows the user to access their profile and logout, which redirects them back to the login screen.

The search bar on the home page enables the user to search for hotels in a specific city or near their current location by retrieving their latitude and longitude. When the user selects a hotel, they can choose their check-in and check-out dates, select the number of rooms, adults, and children, and then proceed to search for available hotels based on their selection criteria.

The search results page displays a list of available hotels along with the selected check-in and check-out dates, adult count, and room count in the toolbar.
